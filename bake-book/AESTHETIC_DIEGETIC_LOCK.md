# Aesthetics / diegetic lock (fulcrumRust)

Parked from Evan (2026-09-07).

## Diegetic labels — **Augury smart-glasses**

Analysis-knowledge-core in-world labels (interacts, extract points, section samplers):
- Thin white mono, fully embodied in world space
- Lead lines + angular digital junk
- Subtle glitches / digital artifacts around the overlays
- Spatially dynamic (not flat HUD chrome)

**Ammo is not glasses.** Glasses stay labels only — never a second ammo HUD.
Shipped label examples: stamp materials · `LOCUS  STANDARD|INKED  <brain>` · ToD/exposure · `INSPECT` (hold-` #28) · lean/slide/speed/height peeks.

## Diegetic gun chrome — **Range Tech** (Sulfur frame)

Ammo lives on the weapon:
- Mag dots / diegetic ammo chrome on the seated feel-lab kit (receiver rail LEDs + plaque; fulcrumRust #14 + #22)
- Well count **is** mag size — MP9-Z **20** / SR-25 **20** / M24 **5**; Hold-R peek becomes that chrome, not a second counter
- Barrel heat stays diegetic on the gun unless a separate heat-tell says otherwise
- Optic hoods + .45 can are Range Tech attachments (**V** / **N**, kit allow-list); glasses still labels only
- World drop/pickup (fulcrumRust #19): chrome travels with the loose kit UUID; empty hands hide viewmodel / heat — still no HUD ammo counter
- Hold-` inspect (fulcrumRust #28): reload-lift look-over overlay so the receiver faces the lens; glasses may flash `INSPECT` — still no numeric ammo HUD

## Readable floor hotspots

Floor/wall aftermath (spills, barrel-choir embers, Lab-Rat stamps) stays readable without softlocking the path. Locus hotspot FX language later — see `SULFUR_INFLUENCE.md`.

## Grimdark Locus terraforming (shipped Lab-Rat #20)

Aesthetic lock for Lab-Rat stamps + Range Tech FX contrast (wet-lab → main via fulcrumRust #20):
- **Hellish void spores** — Locus growth language, not cute mushrooms; yard reads webbing / fruiting body / spore tips
- **Cracks / edge-wear** driven by **2D mushroom density stamps** (`density_stamp_2d` → `WearStamp` on concrete)
- **Brutalist concrete** with procedural wear as the hard backdrop; glasses still labels only (`CONCRETE  STAMP`)
- **Grimdark material grade** — crushed luma on dirt / sand / rock / concrete / organic; organic bleed = void-spore takeover
- Range Tech: grimdark tracers / heat / muzzle on that concrete contrast; performant first
- Detail shelf: `STAMP_FEEL_LOCK.md` + fulcrumRust `docs/STAMPS.md`

## Grimdark extract host (shipped Hypha #16)

House `AESTHETIC_DIEGETIC_LOCK` on the Transvoxel host — terrain reads **grim/dense**, not a bright sandbox:
- **Ashen wash / slate sides / brutalist** vertex paint from Lab-Rat `VoxelMaterial::tint` (no second material story)
- Proc **edge-wear / hairline cracks** + denser mid-frequency rubble; void-spore stamp peek tints
- Extract clear is **dimmer** + dual colder lights + **cheap distance haze** (`fs_world`); hideout stays small / unfogged
- Performant first — bake-once mesh, no live carve day-one
- Detail: `TERRAIN_NORTHSTAR.md` + fulcrumRust `docs/TERRAIN.md`

## Extract day/night sky (shipped Range Tech #24)

Feel-lab clock drives extract atmosphere — still grim/dense, not a bright sandbox:
- **One ToD sample** lights ambient / key / fill / fog + procedural dome together (**no XOR sky**)
- **`EXTRACT_SKY_LUMA` 0.20** crushes noon so day stays ashen; default clock **06:21**; Day HDRI parked
- Hideout stays authored interior / unfogged — ToD does not leak inside
- Glasses may show `06:21  DAWN  EXP 1.44` (or live band) as labels only — never a second ammo HUD
- Detail: `FULCRUMRUST_LAST_PASS_LOCK.md` + fulcrumRust `engine/src/sky.rs`

## Influence north-stars (shortcut aesthetics)

| Influence | Steal |
|-----------|-------|
| **Forever Winter** | Scale-sized maps; smaller level instances connected by tunnels on a world map (connectors, not deep guts) |
| **Beta Decay** | Lowfi graphic energy (FoW-adjacent) |
| **Devil Daggers** / similar Steam indies | Tight lethal feel, readable silhouettes |
| **NaissanceE** | World structure + scale |
| **Akira** | Layered tech / city-decay energy |
| **Zdzisław Beksiński** | Mushroom / bio-growth nightmare — loud-scar stamp lane |
| **Nivanh Chanthara** / **Mortal Shell** artists / **Maciej Kuciara** | Gritty, detailed, believable-yet-unbelievable; layered technique |
| **Sulfur** | Diegetic mag dots + readable floor hotspots (language only) |

Also: FoW lowfi skin; Lab-Rat stamps as bake north-stars (not live stew).
