# Aesthetics / diegetic lock (fulcrumRust)

Parked from Evan (2026-09-07).

## Diegetic labels — **Augury smart-glasses**

Analysis-knowledge-core in-world labels (interacts, extract points, section samplers):
- Thin white mono, fully embodied in world space
- Lead lines + angular digital junk
- Subtle glitches / digital artifacts around the overlays
- Spatially dynamic (not flat HUD chrome)

**Ammo is not glasses.** Glasses stay labels only — never a second ammo HUD.

## Diegetic gun chrome — **Range Tech** (Sulfur frame)

Ammo lives on the weapon:
- Mag dots / diegetic ammo chrome on the **MP9-Z** viewmodel (receiver rail LEDs + stick plaque; feel-lab silhouette, fulcrumRust #14)
- Hold-R peek becomes that chrome, not a second counter
- Barrel heat stays diegetic on the gun unless a separate heat-tell says otherwise
- Optic hoods + .45 can are Range Tech attachments (**V** / **N**); glasses still labels only
- World drop/pickup (fulcrumRust #19): chrome travels with the loose kit UUID; empty hands hide viewmodel / heat — still no HUD ammo counter

## Readable floor hotspots

Floor/wall aftermath (spills, barrel-choir embers, Lab-Rat stamps) stays readable without softlocking the path. Locus hotspot FX language later — see `SULFUR_INFLUENCE.md`.

## Grimdark Locus terraforming (shipped Lab-Rat #20)

Aesthetic lock for Lab-Rat stamps + Range Tech FX contrast (wet-lab → main via fulcrumRust #20):
- **Hellish void spores** — Locus growth language, not cute mushrooms; yard reads webbing / fruiting body / spore tips
- **Cracks / edge-wear** driven by **2D mushroom density stamps** (`density_stamp_2d` → `WearStamp` on concrete)
- **Brutalist concrete** with procedural wear as the hard backdrop; glasses still labels only (`CONCRETE  STAMP`)
- **Grimdark material grade** — crushed luma on dirt / sand / rock / concrete / organic; organic bleed = void-spore takeover
- Range Tech: grimdark tracers / heat / muzzle on that concrete contrast; performant first
- Detail shelf: `STAMP_FEEL_LOCK.md` + fulcrumRust `docs/STAMPS.md`

## Grimdark extract host (shipped Hypha #16)

House `AESTHETIC_DIEGETIC_LOCK` on the Transvoxel host — terrain reads **grim/dense**, not a bright sandbox:
- **Ashen wash / slate sides / brutalist** vertex paint from Lab-Rat `VoxelMaterial::tint` (no second material story)
- Proc **edge-wear / hairline cracks** + denser mid-frequency rubble; void-spore stamp peek tints
- Extract clear is **dimmer** + dual colder lights + **cheap distance haze** (`fs_world`); hideout stays small / unfogged
- Performant first — bake-once mesh, no live carve day-one
- Detail: `TERRAIN_NORTHSTAR.md` + fulcrumRust `docs/TERRAIN.md`

## Influence north-stars (shortcut aesthetics)

| Influence | Steal |
|-----------|-------|
| **Forever Winter** | Scale-sized maps; smaller level instances connected by tunnels on a world map (connectors, not deep guts) |
| **Beta Decay** | Lowfi graphic energy (FoW-adjacent) |
| **Devil Daggers** / similar Steam indies | Tight lethal feel, readable silhouettes |
| **NaissanceE** | World structure + scale |
| **Akira** | Layered tech / city-decay energy |
| **Zdzisław Beksiński** | Mushroom / bio-growth nightmare — loud-scar stamp lane |
| **Nivanh Chanthara** / **Mortal Shell** artists / **Maciej Kuciara** | Gritty, detailed, believable-yet-unbelievable; layered technique |
| **Sulfur** | Diegetic mag dots + readable floor hotspots (language only) |

Also: FoW lowfi skin; Lab-Rat stamps as bake north-stars (not live stew).
